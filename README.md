# Pokedex CLI

Welcome to Pokedex CLI! 
This is a for-fun project to help me learn various standard go libraries. It allows the user to interact with the Pokeapi to navigate through different areas, catch pokemon, and inspect their stats.
Some features I have used are goroutines for creating a cache and for getting commands from the terminal.
